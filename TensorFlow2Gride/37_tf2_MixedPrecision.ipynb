    "Mixed precision is the use of both 16-bit and 32-bit floating-point types in a model during training to make it run faster and use less memory. By keeping certain parts of the model in the 32-bit types for numeric stability, the model will have a lower step time and train equally as well in terms of the evaluation metrics such as accuracy. This guide describes how to use the Keras mixed precision API to speed up your models. Using this API can improve performance by more than 3 times on modern GPUs and 60% on TPUs."

    "Today, most models use the float32 dtype, which takes 32 bits of memory. However, there are two lower-precision dtypes, float16 and bfloat16, each which take 16 bits of memory instead. Modern accelerators can run operations faster in the 16-bit dtypes, as they have specialized hardware to run 16-bit computations and 16-bit dtypes can be read from memory faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "NVIDIA GPUs can run operations in float16 faster than in float32, and TPUs can run operations in bfloat16 faster than float32. Therefore, these lower-precision dtypes should be used whenever possible on those devices. However, variables and a few computations should still be in float32 for numeric reasons so that the model trains to the same quality. The Keras mixed precision API allows you to use a mix of either float16 or bfloat16 with float32, to get the performance benefits from float16/bfloat16 and the numeric stability benefits from float32.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In this guide, the term \"numeric stability\" refers to how a model's quality is affected by the use of a lower-precision dtype instead of a higher precision dtype. We say an operation is \"numerically unstable\" in float16 or bfloat16 if running it in one of those dtypes causes the model to have worse evaluation accuracy or other metrics compared to running the operation in float32."

    "\n",
    "The basic concept of loss scaling is simple: simply multiply the loss by some large number, say $1024$. We call this number the *loss scale*. This will cause the gradients to scale by $1024$ as well, greatly reducing the chance of underflow. Once the final gradients are computed, divide them by $1024$ to bring them back to their correct values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pseudocode for this process is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "loss_scale = 1024\n",
    "loss = model(inputs)\n",
    "loss *= loss_scale\n",
    "# We assume `grads` are float32. We do not want to divide float16 gradients\n",
    "grads = compute_gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)\n",
    "grads /= loss_scale\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing a loss scale can be tricky. If the loss scale is too low, gradients may still underflow to zero. If too high, the opposite the problem occurs: the gradients may overflow to infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this, TensorFlow dynamically determines the loss scale so you do not have to choose one manually. If you use `tf.keras.Model.fit`, loss scaling is done for you so you do not have to do any extra work. If you use a custom training loop, you must explicitly use the special optimizer wrapper `tf.keras.mixed_precision.LossScaleOptimizer` in order to use loss scaling. This is described in the next section.\n"

    "If it doesn't affect model quality, try running with double the batch size when using mixed precision. As float16 tensors use half the memory, this often allows you to double your batch size without running out of memory. Increasing batch size typically increases training throughput, i.e. the training elements per second your model can run on.\n",

However, Tensor Cores requires certain dimensions of tensors to be a multiple of 8. In the examples below, an argument is bold if and only if it needs to be a multiple of 8 for Tensor Cores to be used.\n",
